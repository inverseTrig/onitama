# Onitama

Onitama is table-top board game that involves two players that share five move sets. Each player starts off with four Pawns and a Master Pawn, each player makes a move based on the card they have in hand. Once a move is made with a certain card, the card is passed to the other player.

When a Master Pawn reaches the enemy's gateway, a victor emerges. Otherwise, like Chess, the Master Pawn can be taken down to victory.
